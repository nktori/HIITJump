# HIITJump

An Android application to help keep track of a High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) jump-rope workout.

## TODO

* Cleanup layouts (make more robust, don't hardcode positions)
* Make design nicer
* Exercise in notification

N.B.: I am not an Android developer. This project is purely used as a learning exercise.
